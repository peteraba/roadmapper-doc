[Roadmapper](https://github.com/peteraba/roadmapper) is an open source application designed to make it easy to create presentable and trackable roadmaps. It has two primary features:

1. It can be used as a command line tool to process text files and convert them into images.

2. It can be used to operate as a web service. It can be self-hosted, or there's an online version available under [rdmp.app](https://rdmp.app).

Please note that while `rdmp.app` is free to use, it may converge from the open source offering, may be shut down without prior notice or may even introduce features and or restrictions not present in the open source versions without further notice.

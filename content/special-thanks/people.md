There are a few people we find absolutely influential for the creation of [Roadmapper](https://github.com/peteraba/roadmapper):

 - [Bryan Lunduke](https://lunduke.com/pages/about/) for teaching the world about data privacy and open source software. His recurring take on why [Linux sucks](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLgkr4-AWobWGhF7VnxjHmKkIgGnrOV0BL) is also great fun.

[Roadmapper](https://github.com/peteraba/roadmapper) is an open source tool and [rdmp.app](https://rdmp.app) is a free to use online service.

### Roadmapper

The best way to support the project is to star it on [Github](https://github.com/peteraba/roadmapper), or you can buy the original author a coffee on [buymeacoffee](https://www.buymeacoffee.com/peteraba). 

### rdmp.app

**Rdmp.app** requires a domain and hardware to operate, plus regular maintenance. This means it costs money and it's not necessarily cheap, even if we generally recommend a self-hosted solution.

The current plan is that the continuous development of the project will be mostly founded by some sort of advertisement on [rdmp.app](https://rdmp.app).

In the meanwhile, the best way to support the project is to star it on [Github](https://github.com/peteraba/roadmapper).
